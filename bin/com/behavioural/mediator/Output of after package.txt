Call 1 - calling a1method with 2 as input
In a1method, calling b1method with input = 2.0
In d1method, input is 2.0 and returning float interpretation of the string
In method b1method trimming float to int
Output = Squared using c1method output = 4


Call 2 - calling d2method with 5.0 as input
In a1method, calling b1method with input = 5.0
In d1method, input is 5.0 and returning float interpretation of the string
In method b1method trimming float to int
Output = Squared using c1method output = 25
