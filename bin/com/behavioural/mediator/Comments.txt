In this example we show what was the situation before, this exists in the package named "before"
the "after" package contains our design after we used mediator pattern

//Step 1, 2, 3, and 4a
The interaction sequence is 
1. A one method a1method which calls method of B and then calls C
2. B has a method which calls D in turn
3. C has a method but does not call any methods of other classes.
4. D has two methods
    a. One looks similar to the method in A
    b. D has a method which does not call methods of other classes.
    
//Step 4b
Similiarity - we identify that a1method and d2method are repeated.

//Step 4c
Combination - we do not have any such methods in this example.
